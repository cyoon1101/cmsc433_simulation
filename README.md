# Restaurant simulation
The goal of this project is to simulate running a restaurant. The restaurant will have parameters of: # of customers, # of tables, # of cooks, and the count of each type of machine in the kitchen used for making the food. The restaurant has a total of 4 different food items(fries, pizza, subs, and soda). This is a multithreaded program that will allow for many different functions and operations to be running at the same time.
